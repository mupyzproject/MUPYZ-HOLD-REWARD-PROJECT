# MUPYZ-HOLD-REWARD-PROJECT
REPOSITORY FOR HELP IN THE MUPYZ HOLD REWARDS AIRDROPS PROJECT, FOR THE "ENDLESS AIR EARN PROTOCOL", SMART CONTRACT RUST SOLANA

MUPYZ Project (Temporary Fictitious Name)
The real name is in the process of registration. Once completed, the information here will be updated. The project is slightly delayed compared to the imminent start of the alt season, hence the need for my full-time dedication to the project.

Description
1. Overview
MUPYZ is an innovative crypto project, similar to DeFi, but designed to reward holders with small continuous daily or weekly airdrops through a smart contract protocol called "ENDLESS AIR EARN PROTOCOL". The Solana network token will have a programmed burn fee of 0.188% per transaction, with the difference that the tokens will be transferred proportionally to eligible wallets instead of being "burned" (lost). The smart contract will be audited and tested for certification by a recognized company, such as OpenZeppelin.

2. Eligibility
To be eligible, you must maintain a minimum amount of tokens (300). This number may need to be adjusted in the future due to the token's appreciation, to allow new holders to join. Holders must keep the tokens in a compatible wallet of their choice for a minimum of 30 days. No missions or complicated procedures are required; just buy and hold the tokens in any compatible wallet for as long as desired. Eligibility will be verified through Solscan on the Solana network.

3. Exclusions
Three project wallet addresses must be programmed to not receive these rewards.

4. Future Development
In the following months, a DApp for integration, governance, and awareness will be developed or adapted, where holders will receive incentives. In this DApp, holders can gradually swap their tokens on periodic dates to minimize the selling pressure that could occasionally negatively affect the token's value due to the continuous small airdrops.

Tokenomics
1. Total Supply
The MUPYZ project token will have a total supply of 888.137.142 million tokens and will soon be ready to take off and bring the community along to the moon. An initial attraction will be the reservation of 60% of the tokens for periodic airdrops to eligible loyal holders.

2. Promotional Game
The project will also have a worldwide game of uncovering and following online clues, lasting 50 days. The clues will be hidden on the website, social media, and Google Maps Street View. New clues will appear weekly. There will be two individual challenges, open to all, with 300 winners sharing 5 million tokens for each challenge. Verified winners who are loyal holders will receive double the prize.

3. Phase 2026
In the second half of 2026, something unprecedented in the crypto space will begin, resulting in a unique reward percentage in the form of RWA for loyal holders. More details will be revealed soon.

4. Rewards for Contributors
A portion of the tokens reserved for the project team will be used to reward GitHub contributors who effectively work on the described smart contract and later with the DApp. Developers may become part of the team.

Objectives
1. Continuous Rewards
Provide continuous rewards to holders without missions or complicated procedures, standing out for its strong inclusivity. Facilitate the participation of individuals with little technical knowledge and limited financial resources.

2. Inclusion
MUPYZ allows anyone, regardless of their experience with cryptocurrencies, to participate and benefit from the continuous rewards offered by the system.

Key Points of Inclusion
Simple Accessibility: The acquisition and retention process is designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, allowing even those with no crypto experience to participate without complications.
Low Entry Cost: With the possibility of starting with small investments, it is accessible to low-income individuals, promoting financial inclusion.
Constant Rewards: The continuous airdrop system ensures that all holders receive regular rewards, encouraging participation and loyalty to the project.
Education and Support: We provide educational materials and community support to help new users better understand the project and how to maximize their benefits.
3. Community Growth
Encourage active participation and growth of the MUPYZ community.

4. Transparency and Security
Ensure that all operations are transparent and secure.
