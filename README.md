MUPYZ-HOLD-REWARD-PROJECT
REPOSITORY FOR HELP IN THE MUPYZ HOLD REWARDS AIRDROPS PROJECT, FOR THE "ENDLESS AIR EARN PROTOCOL", SMART CONTRACT RUST SOLANA

MUPYZ Project (Temporary Fictitious Name)
The real name is in the process of registration. Once completed, the information here will be updated. The project is slightly delayed compared to the imminent start of the alt season, hence the need for my full-time dedication to the project.

Description
1. Overview
MUPYZ is an innovative crypto project, similar to DeFi, but designed to reward holders with small continuous daily or weekly airdrops through a smart contract protocol called "ENDLESS AIR EARN PROTOCOL". The Solana network token will have a programmed burn fee of 0.188% per transaction, with the difference that the tokens will be transferred proportionally to eligible wallets instead of being "burned" (lost). The smart contract will be audited and tested for certification by a recognized company, such as OpenZeppelin.

2. Eligibility
To be eligible, you must maintain a minimum amount of tokens (300). This number may need to be adjusted in the future due to the token's appreciation, to allow new holders to join. Holders must keep the tokens in a compatible wallet of their choice for a minimum of 30 days. No missions or complicated procedures are required; just buy and hold the tokens in any compatible wallet for as long as desired. Eligibility will be verified through Solscan on the Solana network.

3. Exclusions
Three project wallet addresses must be programmed to not receive these rewards.

4. Future Development
In the following months, a DApp for integration, governance, and awareness will be developed or adapted, where holders will receive incentives. In this DApp, holders can gradually swap their tokens on periodic dates to minimize the selling pressure that could occasionally negatively affect the token's value due to the continuous small airdrops.
